This project represents my final paper for the class “R for Empirical Economics Research” with Prof Griffen at The University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Economics. At the same time, it constitutes my first attempt to replicate an academic paper published in a highly renowned journal. 

At the start of the project, I contacted both authors of the original paper published in the American Economic Review. Unfortunately, they could not provide access to their original data. Thus, the data used in this paper was obtained from the website of the American Economic Review (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171008) as replication package (https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113492/version/V1/view).

Nontheless, I was not able to replicate their original results. This issue was not further discussed due to time restrictions but I informed both authors.
